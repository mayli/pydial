NOTE: PyDial is currently pre-alpha, and in the middle of being ported from Python 2.7 to Python 3.x. The 2.x client branch basically works; the 2.x server can answer UPnP discovery requests, but doesn't implement the rest of DIAL. The 3.x client/server kit is mid-port and may not be working at any given moment. As of 4/19/14, server discovery was working but other client funcionts hadn't been tested and the server could respond to UPnP discovery requests.

Simple Python client and server for the DIAL protocol.

The DIAL (DIscovery And Launch) protocol enables devices to request display devices on the same LAN/WLAN segment (like smart TVs, Chromecast, and other multimedia devices) to play back media on their behalf. It is used by Google's Chromecast device to stream YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and other services, allowing you to control playback from a smartphone, tablet, or other computer while displaying content on a large screen.

DIAL is built on top of parts of the UPnP and HTTP protocols. UPnP is used for discovering DIAL-enabled devices on your network segment; HTTP is used for requesting and controlling playback. App developers can build their own protocols for controlling authentication, playback, etc. on top of the DIAL protocol.

PyDial aims at being a simple implementation of the DIAL protocol, suitable for prototyping DIAL-enabled functions on first screen (display device) or second screen (control/client device) devices that understand Python. You can also use it to develop desktop apps that can interact with DIAL devices.

DIAL was developed by Netflix and Google; complete details are available here: http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/
